There is value in identifying parts of the Strategic Road Network (SRN) that overlap with potential active travel links with high walking, wheeling and cycling potential.

On 25th November National Highways published new 'RedLine' data with the boundary of its sites in England.
The dataset is available at [opendata.nationalhighways.co.uk](https://opendata.nationalhighways.co.uk/datasets/highwaysengland::redline/explore?location=53.785976%2C-1.542063%2C17.19) and looks like this (example from Leeds):

We can get estimates of active travel potential from the open PCT data and overlay that with the RedLine data.
Applying a 500 m buffer around the simulated cycle network with high potential --- with at least 100 trips per day in the PCT under the Government Target scenario --- leads to the following areas being flagged, in West Yorkshire for example, with Cycling potential representing the Ebike scenario:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
redline = sf::read_sf("Highway_Boundary_(RedLine).geojson")
region = pct::get_pct_zones(region = "west-yorkshire")
redline_region = redline[region, ]
redline_region_union = sf::st_union(redline_region)
redline_region_union_simple = rmapshaper::ms_simplify(redline_region_union)
pct_region = pct::get_pct_rnet("west-yorkshire")
pct_high = pct_region %>% 
  filter(govtarget_slc > 100)
pct_high_buffer = pct_high %>% 
  stplanr::geo_buffer(dist = 5000)
redline_region_intersection = sf::st_intersection(pct_high_buffer, redline_region_union_simple)
mapview::mapview(redline_region_intersection)
sf::write_sf(redline_region_intersection, "redline_region_intersection.geojson")
qtm(redline_region_intersection)
brks = c(0, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000)
redline_region_intersection %>% 
  sf::st_cast("MULTIPOLYGON") %>% 
  mutate(`Cycling potential` = ebike_slc) %>% 
  tm_shape() +
  tm_polygons("Cycling potential", palette = "viridis", breaks = brks) +
  tm_basemap(server = leaflet::providers$CartoDB.DarkMatter) +
  tm_scale_bar()
```

This approach can be scaled nationally. We could modify the method or show different scenarios but, as a proof of concept, it demonstrates the potential to link up with NH on the data side of things.
